## Description
This React application implements a simple counter functionality. Users can increment or decrement a counter value within a specified range. If the counter reaches its maximum value, an alert notifies the user that the storage is full. Conversely, if the counter reaches its minimum value, another alert prompts the user to add more values before removal.

## Features
- Increment and decrement counter functionality.
- Alert messages for storage full and remove limit conditions.

## Technologies Used
- React
- useState hook

4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Usage
Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application. You can interact with the counter by clicking the "Add value" and "Remove value" buttons.
